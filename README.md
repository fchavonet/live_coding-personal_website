# Personal Website

## Description

This project was developed as part of a live coding series (3 sessions) at Holberton School Toulouse.

The goal was to create a simple personal website to show students they can build something functional, responsive, and clean in just a few hours.

During Holbertonâ€™s second year, students are asked to create their own personal website in just 48 hours. This live coding project demonstrates that, with a minimal amount of code and using Bootstrap, it is possible to achieve a decent result in a short timeframe.

It is not intended to be a full-featured portfolio, but rather a basic and modest example that students can use as a starting point.

Watch the live coding sessions here:

- [First live coding session (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaD9aBu7st4).
- [Second live coding session (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAuzjdw4u0w).
- Third live coding session (FR) - *Coming soon*.

## Objectives

- Show how to quickly build a basic website with Bootstrap.
- Provide a minimal reference project for Holberton students.
- Practice working under time constraints (48 hours for the real project, ~4 hours for this demo).
- Keep the code as simple as possible, to stay accessible to beginners.

## What's Next?

- Add new sections (e.g., skills, tech stack...).  
- Externalize project data into a separate file instead of keeping it directly in the JS script. 
- Improve the overall UI while keeping the minimalist approach.  

## Thanks

- Special thanks to those who provided feedback during and after the live coding sessions.
